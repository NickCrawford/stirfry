      <h3>Summer - Heating up...</h3>
      <p>During the summer, Nick and Ben found themselves personally taking on various freelance projects. As these projects began to stack up, both their depth and breadth of work expanded. They learned new skills, technologies, and best-practices. It was about time to put these new skills to the test. It was time to launch an official agency.</p>
